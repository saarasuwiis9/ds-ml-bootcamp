### Question 1
Machine Learning involves developing algorithms that allow computers to learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks. A prime example is the Netflix recommendation engine, which analyzes a user's viewing history to predict and suggest future content that aligns with their preferences.

### Question 2
The primary distinction lies in the use of labeled data. Supervised learning utilizes a dataset where the desired output is known (e.g., classifying images labeled as "cats" or "dogs"). In contrast, Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data to identify inherent structures or groupings, such as segmenting customers based on purchasing behavior analysis.

### Question 3
Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too closely, capturing noise and random fluctuations rather than the underlying distribution. This results in poor performance on new, unseen data—analogous to a student memorizing specific practice questions but failing to understand the general concepts required for the actual exam.

---

### Question 4
Data is typically partitioned into a training set and a test set (commonly in an 80/20 ratio). This separation is critical to validate the model's performance; by training on one subset and testing on an independent "hold-out" set, we can verify that the model generalizes well to new data rather than simply memorizing the training examples.

### Question 5
Moving beyond traditional tech applications, Machine Learning is making significant strides in **Agriculture**. A notable study focused on crop yield prediction in Rwanda demonstrates this impact (Niyigena et al., 2022).

**Methodology:**
Researchers employed **Random Forest Regression** to forecast maize and Irish potato yields. The model was trained on historical weather data, including rainfall patterns, temperature variations, and soil quality metrics.

**Significance:**
Prior to this implementation, agricultural planning relied largely on traditional knowledge, which has become less reliable due to climate change variables. The ML model significantly outperformed traditional prediction methods. This improvement is critical for enhancing national food security planning and enabling farmers to make data-driven decisions regarding seed selection and resource allocation in response to predicted weather conditions.
