1. Title & Collection Method
Title:
Titanic – Machine Learning from Disaster (Passenger Survival Dataset)
Collection Method:
This dataset was manually created by simulating Titanic passenger records based on historical knowledge of the Titanic disaster.
Each row represents a passenger, and features include passenger class, gender, age group, family size, fare category, and port of embarkation.
Some entries intentionally include missing values, typos, and class imbalance to simulate real-world conditions for ML preprocessing practice.

2. Description of Features & Label
Features (X):
1.	Passenger_Class (categorical): First, Second, Third
2.	Gender (categorical): Male, Female
3.	Age_Group (categorical): Child, Adult, Elderly
4.	Family_Size (numeric): Number of family members traveling together
5.	Fare_Category (categorical): Low, Medium, High
6.	Embarked_Port (categorical): Southampton, Cherbourg, Queenstown
Label (y):
•	Survived (binary): Yes / No
This is a classification task predicting survival.

3. Dataset Structure
•	Rows: 120 passengers
•	Columns: 7 (6 features + 1 label)
Sample Table (10 rows)
Passenger_Class	Gender	Age_Group	Family_Size	Fare_Category	Embarked_Port	Survived
First	Female	Adult	1	High	Cherbourg	Yes
Third	Male	Adult	3	Low	Southampton	No
Second	Female	Child	2	Medium	Queenstown	Yes
Third	Male	Adult	0	Low	Southampton	No
First	Male	Elderly	1	High	Cherbourg	No
Second	Female	Adult	1	Medium	Southampton	Yes
Third	Female	Adult	4	Low	Queenstown	Yes
Third	Male	Child	2	Low	Southampton	No
First	Female	Elderly	0	High	Cherbourg	Yes
Second	Male	Adult	1	Medium	Southampton	No

4. Quality Issues
•	Missing values: Age_Group or Embarked_Port
•	Categorical text: Needs encoding (Gender, Class, Port)
•	Typos: Femle instead of Female
•	Class imbalance: More passengers did not survive than survived
•	Mixed formats: Numeric (Family_Size) + categorical (Class, Fare)

5. Use Case
This dataset can be used in ML classification tasks:
•	Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM
•	Applications:
o	Predict passenger survival
o	Understand important features influencing survival
o	Practice preprocessing (encoding, handling missing values, scaling)
