## Reflection

While working on this assignment, I gained a good understanding of Steps 1 to 6 and Step 10 of the data preprocessing. These steps included loading  the dataset, cleaning, fixing categorical errors, handling missing values, removing duplicates, and capping outliers using the IQR method. These steps helped me understand how raw data is cleaned and prepared before applying machine learning models.

I am still learning Steps 7 to 9 and need more practice to understand feature creation, one-hot encoding, and scaling like StandardScaler and log transformation.

Overall, this assignment improved my basic understanding of data preprocessing, and I plan to continue practicing the later steps to strengthen my machine learning skills.
