## Summary

Machine Learning allows computers to learn from data and make predictions without being explicitly programmed.  
Supervised learning uses labeled data, while unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data.  
Overfitting happens when a model memorizes training data instead of learning general patterns.  
Data is split into training and testing to measure real performance.  
A healthcare case study shows ML can accurately detect brain bleeding from CT scans.
