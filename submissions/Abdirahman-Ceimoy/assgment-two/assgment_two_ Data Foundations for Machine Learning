Title

Customer Loyalty Prediction in a Local Grocery Store in Yaqshid District

1. Introduction and Data Collection

For this assignment, I collected my own dataset from a small grocery store located in Yaqshid district. The goal of this dataset is to understand what factors influence whether a customer is likely to return to the store in the following month.

I collected the data by asking customers short questions after they completed their purchases. Participation was voluntary. In total, I gathered responses from 56 customers over a period of five days.

The questions focused on customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and satisfaction level. The final question asked whether they expect to shop at the same store again next month.

2. Description of Features and Label

The dataset contains the following features:

Age, numerical variable representing the customer’s age.

Gender, categorical variable with two values, Male or Female.

Income Level, categorical variable with three levels, Low, Medium, High.

Purchase Frequency, numerical variable representing how many times per month the customer shops at the store.

Average Spending per Visit, numerical variable in USD.

Satisfaction Rating, numerical scale from 1 to 5.

The label variable is:

Will Return Next Month, binary variable with values Yes or No.

This is a classification problem because the target variable has two categories.

3. Dataset Structure

The dataset contains 56 rows and 7 columns. Each row represents one customer.

The dataset includes both numerical and categorical variables. Some values are self-reported, especially satisfaction and income level.

4. Data Quality Issues

During data collection, several issues were observed:

A few customers did not want to provide income information.

Some satisfaction ratings were inconsistent.

There is a slight imbalance in the target variable, since more customers responded “Yes” than “No”.

Because the data was collected manually, minor entry errors are possible.

These issues make the dataset realistic and suitable for preprocessing and cleaning.

5. Use Case in Machine Learning

This dataset can be used to build a classification model that predicts customer loyalty. The business can use such a model to identify customers who are less likely to return and improve customer retention strategies.

Possible algorithms include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
