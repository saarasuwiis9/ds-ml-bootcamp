1. Definition of Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a scientific field within Artificial Intelligence that focuses on enabling computer systems to automatically learn from data and improve their decision-making ability without explicit human-defined rules.

Original real-life example:
In agriculture, ML systems analyze satellite images and weather data to predict crop diseases early, helping farmers take preventive action before crops are damaged.

2. Supervised Learning vs Unsupervised Learning

Supervised Learning involves training models on labeled datasets, where the desired output is known in advance.
Example: Predicting student graduation outcomes using labeled academic records (pass/fail).

Unsupervised Learning analyzes unlabeled data to identify hidden structures or relationships.
Example: Detecting unusual network traffic patterns to identify cybersecurity threats without prior attack labels.

Learning Type	Data Type	Purpose	Example
Supervised	Labeled	Prediction	Student outcome prediction
Unsupervised	Unlabeled	Pattern discovery	Network anomaly detection
3. Overfitting: Causes and Prevention

Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model captures random noise instead of meaningful patterns, leading to poor performance on unseen data.

Causes:

Excessively complex models

Limited training samples

Prevention:

Applying regularization techniques

Using cross-validation

Reducing model complexity

4. Training and Test Data Split

Datasets are divided into training and test sets (commonly 70–80% training, 20–30% testing).

The training set enables learning, while the test set evaluates how well the model generalizes. This separation is necessary to ensure realistic performance assessment and to detect overfitting.

5. Case Study: Machine Learning in Transportation

A transportation study applied machine learning to predict traffic congestion using GPS and road sensor data.

Findings:

ML models accurately predicted congestion patterns

Improved traffic flow management

Reduced travel time and fuel consumption

This demonstrates how ML enhances intelligent transportation systems.
