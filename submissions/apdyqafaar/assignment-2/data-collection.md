# Daily Habits Dataset

## About the Dataset
This dataset was collected by me for a Machine Learning assignment.  
The goal was to create my own dataset instead of using ready-made datasets from the internet.

The data focuses on daily habits of students and young professionals and how these habits relate to productivity.

## How the Data Was Collected
I collected this data manually by asking people around me (friends, classmates, and colleagues) about their daily routines.  
Some values were recorded based on observation and self-reporting.

No external datasets (such as Kaggle or UCI) were used.
