## Summary (Assignment 1)

Assignment 1 summarizes what Machine Learning (ML) is and gives a real‑life example (movie recommendations). It distinguishes supervised learning (labeled data) from unsupervised learning (unlabeled data), and explains overfitting and how to prevent it (train/test split, regularization, early stopping, etc.). It also highlights the importance of splitting training and testing data and presents a healthcare case study on heart‑disease prediction. The conclusion emphasizes that ML improves decision‑making by learning from data.
