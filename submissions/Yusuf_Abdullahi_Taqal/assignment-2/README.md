## Assignment Overview – Data Foundations for Machine Learning (Assignment 2)

This project was completed as **Assignment 2** for a Machine Learning course and focuses on **data collection, and feature understanding**.

### Folder Structure

#### `data/`

* Contains the collected dataset in two formats:

  * `github_repos.csv`
  * `github_repos.xlsx`
* Both files store the same GitHub repository data collected via the GitHub public API.
* The dataset includes repositories created between **2015 and 2024** and is intended for machine learning experimentation.

#### `pdf/`

* Contains the research paper in PDF format.
* The paper explains:

  * How the dataset was collected
  * Feature and label selection
  * Dataset structure
  * Data quality issues
  * Potential machine learning use cases

### Purpose

* Demonstrate practical data collection from a real-world API
* Practice dataset analysis before model training
* Prepare data suitable for regression or classification tasks
