1. Definition of Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that allows computers to learn from data. Systems improve performance without being explicitly programmed. Algorithms are used to identify patterns. These patterns help in decision making. Accuracy improves with more data. This makes machine learning very powerful.
2. Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
Supervised learning uses labeled data where results are already known. It is commonly used for prediction tasks. Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data. It focuses on discovering hidden patterns. Clustering is a popular unsupervised method. Both methods are important in machine learning.
3. Overfitting: Causes and Prevention
Overfitting happens when a model memorizes training data. This reduces performance on new data. It occurs when models are too complex. Regularization helps reduce overfitting. Cross-validation improves generalization. Proper data handling is very important.
Feature	Supervised Learning	Unsupervised Learning
Data Type	Labeled Data	Unlabeled Data
Goal	Prediction	Pattern Discovery
Example	Medical Diagnosis	Customer Segmentation
4. Training Data vs Test Data
Machine learning models need data for training and testing. Training data teaches the model patterns. Test data evaluates performance. It is not seen during training. Proper splitting avoids bias. This ensures accurate evaluation.
5. Case Study: Machine Learning in Healthcare
Machine learning plays a major role in healthcare. Deep learning models analyze medical images. These systems help detect diseases early. They can reach expert-level accuracy. Doctors benefit from faster diagnosis. Overall healthcare quality is improved.
