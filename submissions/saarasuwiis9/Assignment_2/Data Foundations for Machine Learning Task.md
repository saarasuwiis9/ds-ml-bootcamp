Research Paper: Weather Measurements Dataset
Title & Collection Method
Title: Weather Measurements Dataset

Collection Method:
The dataset was collected by recording daily weather conditions over a period of one month in my local area. Measurements were taken at the same time each day, capturing key weather attributes such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure. A total of 100 daily records were compiled to create this dataset.

Description of Features & Labels
Features (X):
Temperature (°C): The average temperature for the day.
Humidity (%): The average humidity level for the day.
Precipitation (mm): The total amount of rainfall measured for the day.
Wind Speed (km/h): The average wind speed recorded for the day.
Atmospheric Pressure (hPa): The average atmospheric pressure for the day.
Label (y):
Weather Condition: A categorical label indicating the general weather condition for the day (e.g., Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy, Snowy).

Quality Issues
The dataset contains several quality issues:

Missing Values: Some days had incomplete data, particularly for wind speed and precipitation.
Inconsistent Units: A few entries for temperature were recorded in Fahrenheit instead of Celsius, requiring standardization.
Imbalance: The dataset may be imbalanced, with more sunny days than rainy or snowy conditions, which could affect model performance.
Measurement Errors: There may be small inaccuracies in the recorded values due to equipment calibration or environmental factors.
Use Case
This dataset could be utilized to train a classification model to predict the general weather condition based on numerical weather measurements. Possible machine learning algorithms that could be used include:

Logistic Regression: To predict categorical outcomes based on linear combinations of input features.
Decision Trees: To model decisions based on feature splits that lead to different weather conditions.
Random Forest: To improve prediction accuracy by combining multiple decision trees and reducing overfitting.
By analyzing this data, meteorologists and researchers could improve weather forecasting models and better understand local climate patterns.


This practical assignment has provided valuable experience in collecting and organizing weather data, emphasizing the importance of quality and accuracy in real-world datasets. The next steps will involve cleaning and preprocessing this dataset in Lesson 3 to prepare it for machine learning analysis.
