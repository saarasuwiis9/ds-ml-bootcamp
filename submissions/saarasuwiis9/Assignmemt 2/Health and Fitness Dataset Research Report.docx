Health and Fitness Dataset Research Report
This dataset is about tracking exercise and health information for four different people over the course of one year, from January to December 2024. The data was collected using daily questionnaires that participants filled out. In these questionnaires, people reported information about their workouts including what type of exercise they did, how long they exercised, and how intense they felt the workout was. They also reported daily health information like how many hours they slept, their stress level, how many steps they took, and how much water they drank. Additionally, they measured and recorded certain health metrics weekly, including their weight, heart rate, and blood pressure.

2. Data Details
The dataset includes several types of information that serve as input features. These include basic personal details like age, gender, and height. Exercise-related features include the type of activity, how many minutes it lasted, and the perceived intensity level. Health measurements include weight, heart rate, blood pressure, hours of sleep, stress level, and daily step count. Lifestyle information includes smoking status and any existing health conditions.

The main output we want to predict or analyze is called "fitness_level," which is a numerical score that represents how fit someone is overall. This score likely increases as people exercise more consistently and improve their health metrics over time.

3. Data Size & Sample
The dataset contains 824 rows, with each row representing one day's exercise session for one participant. There are 22 different columns or pieces of information recorded for each session. A small sample shows Person 1 doing 41 minutes of dancing on January 1st with a low intensity, weighing 53.7 kg, having a heart rate of 103, sleeping 6.6 hours, and receiving a fitness score of 0.04. On January 4th, the same person did 28 minutes of swimming, weighed slightly more at 53.9 kg, had a lower heart rate of 102, slept more at 8.1 hours, and their fitness score increased to 0.07.

4. Data Problems
Several issues exist with this dataset. First, since all data comes from self-reported questionnaires, it may contain inaccuracies because people might forget details or estimate incorrectly. Second, with only four participants, the dataset is quite small, making it hard to draw general conclusions about larger populations. Third, some health measurements like height, resting heart rate, and blood pressure never change throughout the year, which seems unrealistic. Fourth, there are inconsistent time gaps between entries - some days have multiple workouts recorded while other days have none. Finally, some calculated values like calories burned don't always seem to match well with the reported exercise duration and intensity.

5. Machine Learning Uses
This dataset could be used for several machine learning projects. For regression tasks, we could try to predict future weight based on exercise patterns, or estimate fitness scores from workout history. For classification, we could try to identify what type of exercise someone did based on their heart rate and other measurements. For clustering, we could group participants into different fitness profiles based on their exercise preferences and improvement patterns. The data could also help identify which exercise combinations lead to the best fitness improvements over time.
