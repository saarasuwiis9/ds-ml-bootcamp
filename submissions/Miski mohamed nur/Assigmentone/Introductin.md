### DEfine machine learning using real-life example

### Answer:Machine Learning (ML):Enables the systems to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions.
### Example:Learning: The ML algorithm identifies patterns, such as frequent phrases ("free money," "urgent action"),suspicious links, or sender information.

### Question 2 : Compare Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning, giving an example of each?.
### Answer:| Aspect        | Supervised Learning                       | Unsupervised Learning           |
### 
| Training data | **Labeled data** (input + correct output) | **Unlabeled data** (input only) |
| Main goal     | Predict a known outcome                   | Discover hidden patterns        |
| Guidance      | Model learns with a “teacher”             | No teacher or correct answers   |
| Common tasks  | Classification, Regression                | Clustering, Pattern discovery   |

# Example of Supervised Learning

House Price Prediction

Training data includes house features (size, location, rooms) and known prices

The model learns the relationship between features and prices

It predicts the price of a new house
### Example of Unsupervised Learning

Customer Grouping (Clustering)

Data includes customer behavior (age, purchases, visits) without labels

The model groups customers with similar behavior

Businesses use these groups for marketing strategies

 ### What is Overfitting?
 ### Overfitting happens when a machine learning model learns the training data too well, including its noise and details, and as a result performs poorly on new, unseen data.

 ### How Can Overfitting Be Prevented?
--Use More Training Data:More data helps the model learn general patterns
--Simplify the Model:Use fewer features or a less complex model
--Train for Fewer Epochs (Early Stopping):Stop training before the model starts memorizing noise
--Regularization:Techniques like L1 and L2 add penalties for complex models

### How Are Train and Test Data Split?


## Random Splitting

The dataset is shuffled randomly

This avoids bias and ensures fair representation

## mon Split Ratios

80% training / 20% testing (most common)

70% training / 30% testing

90% training / 10% testing (for very large datasets)

Example
Dataset size: 1,000 records

Training data: 800 records

Test data: 200 records
### Why Is Train–Test Splitting Necessary?

## To Measure Real Performance:Shows how the model performs on new data

## To Detect Overfitting:
If the model performs well on training data but poorly on test data → overfitting

## To Improve Model Selection:
Helps compare different models fairly
 ## To Build Reliable Models:
 Ensures the model can generalize to real-world situations
