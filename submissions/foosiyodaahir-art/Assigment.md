Machine Learning Assignment
1. Definition of Machine Learning
Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. Instead of following fixed rules, ML algorithms improve their performance as they are exposed to more data.
Real-Life Example:
One common example of Machine Learning is email spam filtering. The system learns to identify unwanted emails based on past data and automatically separates spam from legitimate emails. Other examples include Netflix recommendations, voice assistants like Siri, and medical diagnosis systems.
2. Supervised Learning vs Unsupervised Learning
Machine Learning can be broadly categorized into Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning.
Supervised Learning:
In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on labeled data, where both inputs and outputs are known.
The goal is to predict or classify outcomes for new, unseen data.
Example: Predicting house prices based on features such as location, size, and number of rooms.
Unsupervised Learning:
In unsupervised learning, the data is unlabeled, and the algorithm attempts to discover hidden patterns or groupings within the data.
Example: Segmenting customers into groups based on their purchasing behavior without pre-defined categories.

3. Overfitting: Causes and Prevention
Overfitting occurs when a Machine Learning model performs very well on training data but fails on new, unseen data. This happens because the model learns not only the underlying patterns but also the noise in the training data.
Causes of Overfitting:
Model complexity (too many parameters)
Insufficient training data
Using too many irrelevant features
Prevention Methods:
Increase the amount of training data
Apply regularization techniques (L1, L2)
Use early stopping during training
Perform cross-validation to check model generalization
4. Training and Test Data: Split and Purpose
Machine Learning models rely on training data to learn patterns and test data to evaluate performance.
Training Data: Used to teach the model and optimize its parameters.
Test Data: A separate dataset used to measure how well the model generalizes to unseen data.
Purpose:
Splitting the data ensures that the model is not simply memorizing the training examples, but instead learning patterns that apply to new situations.
Typical Split Example:
80% Training Data
20% Test Data
5. Case Study: Machine Learning Application in Healthcare
Study Title: Predicting Heart Disease Using Machine Learning Models (2022)
Objective:
The study aimed to develop a Machine Learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health records.
Methodology:
Data included patient demographics, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and lifestyle factors.
Random Forest algorithm was used to train the model.
Findings:

The model achieved 92% accuracy in predicting heart disease.
Machine Learning helped identify key risk factors, enabling early intervention and better patient outcomes.
