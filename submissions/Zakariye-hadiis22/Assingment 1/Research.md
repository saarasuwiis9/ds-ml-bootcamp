Introduction to Machine Learning

Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that enables computer systems to learn from data and improve performance without explicit programming.

Real-Life Example:
Email spam filtering systems learn from labeled emails to classify new messages as spam or not spam.

Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning:
Supervised learning uses labeled data (e.g., house price prediction).
Unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data (e.g., customer segmentation).

Overfitting:
Overfitting happens when a model learns noise in training data.
Prevention methods include regularization, more data, and cross-validation.

Training and Test Data:
Data is split (commonly 80/20) to evaluate model generalization.

Case Study:
Machine learning has been successfully applied in healthcare for diabetes prediction, improving early diagnosis accuracy.
