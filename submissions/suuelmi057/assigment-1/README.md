## **Contents**

1. **Definition of Machine Learning**

   * Explained with a real-life example: YouTube or Netflix recommendations.

2. **Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning**

   * Supervised Learning: Uses labeled data to predict outcomes (Example: Email spam detection).
   * Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns in unlabeled data (Example: Customer grouping).
   * Comparison table included.

3. **Overfitting**

   * Causes of overfitting explained with an example of a student memorizing answers.
   * Prevention methods included.

4. **Training and Test Data**

   * Explanation of splitting data into training and test sets.
   * Real-life example: Learning to drive vs. driving test.

5. **Case Study: Machine Learning in Healthcare**

   * Example: Early detection of breast cancer.
   * Shows how ML helps doctors make faster and accurate decisions.

6. **Conclusion**

   * Machine learning helps computers learn from data and make smart decisions.
   * Everyday applications include emails, shopping, video recommendations, and hospitals.
