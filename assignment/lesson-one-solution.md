### Question 1
Basically, Machine Learning is about teaching computers to spot patterns in data instead of giving them exact rules. A great example is how Netflix suggests movies based on what you've already watched; it "learns" your personal vibe without any manual programming.

---

### Question 2
The main difference is whether the model has a "teacher." Supervised learning uses labeled data (like telling a computer a photo is a "cat"), while unsupervised learning just groups things together based on similarities, like sorting supermarket customers by their shopping habits.

---

### Question 3
Overfitting happens when a model gets too obsessed with the specific training data and starts memorizing noise instead of general patterns. It's like a student who memorizes a practice test word-for-word but fails the real exam because the questions changed slightly.

---

### Question 4
We split data (usually 80/20) so we can train the model on one part and test it on a completely secret "hold-out" set. This is the only way to prove the model actually learned the logic and isn't just cheating by remembering the answers.

### Question 5
While most people think of ML in tech or finance, I found a really interesting application in **Agriculture**, specifically in a study focused on crop yield prediction in Rwanda (published in *MDPI* and other scholarly journals).

**What they did:**
Researchers used a technique called **Random Forest Regression** to predict how much maize and Irish potatoes farmers would harvest. They fed the model years of weather data, including rainfall levels, temperature, and soil quality.

**The Result:**
Before this, farmers and the government mostly guessed their harvests based on traditional knowledge, which is hard when the climate changes. The ML model was able to predict the yield with much higher accuracy than traditional methods. This is huge because it helps the government plan for food security and helps farmers decide which seeds to buy based on the predicted weather patterns.
